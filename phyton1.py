import random # import library

random.normalvariate(5,3) # generate random numbers
test1 = random.normalvariate(5,3)
range(2,8)
vec1 = range(2,8)
vec1

test02 = [2,3,4,5,6,7,8] # The above is the Python equivalent of c(...)


for ii in range(2,8): ii  # created a list
[ii for ii in range(2,8)] # 
#And by putting [ and ] around that, you get a Python list of those values.

test03='x'
print('x')
['x' for ii in range(2,8)]

FOO <- c(); for(ii in 2:8) {FOO <- c(FOO,'x')}

exit
